# Vite Worldclock React App

This project is a React app using Vite as the build tool and development server.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version v16 or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 8.x or higher

## Libraries

- bootstrap
- react-bootstrap
- react-bootstrap-icons
- react-select
- sass

## Getting Started

To start developing, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sigitfrank/worldclock.git
   cd worldclock
   ```
````

Replace `{your_github_username}` and `{your_repository_name}` with the actual repository information.

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will open your default web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5173/. The app will automatically reload when you make changes to the source code.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist` folder. You can serve this folder with any static site hosting service.
